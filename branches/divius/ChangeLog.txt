September 25 2006 Version 0.19
Corrections:
- The code is entirely translated in English, variables, function names and file names.

   2. Test if the location finded on 1 is good, otherwise display a dialog for choose qmake location
   In options dialog, it is possible to change the location of qmake anytime.
Adds:
- The classes explorer to navigate into classes and members. By right-click, each item can display the two files of a member or function: implementation and declaration. The double-click shows the implementation if available. The items are updated in real time when the text in editor is modified and the interval between two updates can be configured in options dialog. This new feature require ctags.

Corrections :
- Now detect translated "error" and "warning" strings in gcc logs to show lines on red and blue and to permit the double-click to open editors.
- Crash on starts when last project is not present 
- Rewriting of cpp syntax highlighter. Work well and more quickly. Highlighting is now enabled only for .c, .cpp, .cc and .h files only.
- Remove stranges characters in Build Log window.
- The location of qmake is set during QIde compilation then used to call qmake. But sometimes this location is not good thus in options dialog it is possible configure it.  
- Rewriting of parser who populates the combo classes and methods. Now requires ctags and normally works with all styles of code.
Adds :
- Auto brackets in editor. When "{" is pressed, "}" gets added to the text automatically and text between is indented.
- Highlight current line
- On dialogs, a right-click on item preview the dialog, without opening Designer. Each widget shows a tooltip containing his name and classname.
- Dutch translation
- Find in files
- Improvement of the Qt contextual help. When F1 is pressed on word in editor, Assistant is launched. 
		- If the word is an Qt object, the corresponding page is displayed (qstring.html if the word is QString). 
		- If the word is a function, the page called is the class of this function and in the page the anchor corresponding
		of the word is displayed. Example : in code : QString foo="ab"; foo = foo.remove("a"); If F1 is pressed
		on the word "remove", Assistant shows the page qstring.html at the place of the anchor "remove". That does not work every time because the anchor names are not always identical to the names of functions.
