May 29 2007 Version 0.23

Corrections:
- Prevents the opening of the same file in several tab.
The code completion works now with the classes created in the project.
When the IDE auto-completes some code, it also add the "()" after the cursor, and place the cursor in the best position
possible.
- Fix a problem with packaged versions of QDevelop. With these versions, the code completion did not work.

Adds:
- Add Portuguese translation thanks to Giuliano Santana
- Add Vietnamese translation. Thanks to Chuong Nguyen

April 11 2007 Version 0.22

Corrections:
- Fixed cmake compilation. Now executable is called QDevelop. I think I will have to revert this for UNIX* environemtns, in which the binary should be named qdevelop.

- Fix the kind for field implementation (int to string) in table classesbrowser in database.
- Fix items alignment default in projectpropertie.ui
- In project database, opened files are now saved with relative paths to the project directory. If project directory is moved to other path, the files are correctly reopened. This commit saves relative paths for files in classes browser too.

Adds:
- Add  czech translation language.
- Add Ukrainian translation.
- The application accept now "GNU make" as previously but also others like "FreeBSD make".

   - Add a new variable member
- With a right-click on a member variable of a class in classes browser, it is possible to:
   - Add set and get methods for this variable member.

September 25 2006 Version 0.19
Corrections:
- The code is entirely translated in English, variables, function names and file names. 
- Improvement of completion, much faster (5 or 6 times). An improved code increases its reliability.
- The location of qmake is determined in this order:
   1. Read in INI file the lasted saved location. If it not saved, use : QLibraryInfo::location( QLibraryInfo::BinariesPath )+"/qmake";
   2. Test if the location finded on 1 is good, otherwise display a dialog for choose qmake location
   In options dialog, it is possible to change the location of qmake anytime.
Adds:
- The classes explorer to navigate into classes and members. By right-click, each item can display the two files of a member or function: implementation and declaration. The double-click shows the implementation if available. The items are updated in real time when the text in editor is modified and the interval between two updates can be configured in options dialog. This new feature require ctags.

August 27 2006 Version 0.18

Corrections :
- Now detect translated "error" and "warning" strings in gcc logs to show lines on red and blue and to permit the double-click to open editors.
- Crash on starts when last project is not present 
- Rewriting of cpp syntax highlighter. Work well and more quickly. Highlighting is now enabled only for .c, .cpp, .cc and .h files only.
- Remove stranges characters in Build Log window.
- The location of qmake is set during QIde compilation then used to call qmake. But sometimes this location is not good thus in options dialog it is possible configure it.  
- Rewriting of parser who populates the combo classes and methods. Now requires ctags and normally works with all styles of code.
Adds :
- Auto brackets in editor. When "{" is pressed, "}" gets added to the text automatically and text between is indented.
- Highlight current line
- On dialogs, a right-click on item preview the dialog, without opening Designer. Each widget shows a tooltip containing his name and classname.
- Dutch translation

- Improvement of the Qt contextual help. When F1 is pressed on word in editor, Assistant is launched. 
		- If the word is an Qt object, the corresponding page is displayed (qstring.html if the word is QString). 
		- If the word is a function, the page called is the class of this function and in the page the anchor corresponding
		of the word is displayed. Example : in code : QString foo="ab"; foo = foo.remove("a"); If F1 is pressed
		on the word "remove", Assistant shows the page qstring.html at the place of the anchor "remove". That does not work every time because the anchor names are not always identical to the names of functions.  
- The Project explorer have now two view modes accessible by right click then choose "Show As".
- Close a tab by right-click on it even if it is not the currrent tab.
